10239149,1980s Vintage Custom Square Metal Bronze Coffee Table With Geometric Copper and Silver Square and Rectangular Patterns,"Found this unique vintage gem at an auction in Southern California, was visiting beaches and photographing coastal views. During viewing the session I found this coffee table and was struck by the geometric patterns and searched for examples of this on my phone, what I found surprised me - it can be found in various cultures and time periods, including ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Greeks, as well as modern and contemporary art movements. Wow. I read on,Geometric art often emphasizes symmetry, order, and precision. It explores the relationships between shapes, lines, colors, and proportions. Artists working in this style may use basic geometric shapes such as squares, circles, triangles, or more complex forms like polygons, spirals, or fractals. Wow.
That sold me,  not only is the piece striking, optically pleasant but structurally sound. All metal, including the legs. I lifted one side, it was heavy then I looked at the underside and discovered that the legs can be taken apart held together by hex nuts and bolts. Very sturdy. I decided I had to have that piece and my wife agreed. Wow. We waited for a while before the lot came up and the bidding began. The bidding war began slowly and build into a frenzy (don&#x27;t they always) in the end I took it apart and loaded it onto my pickup truck. Came home a winner.",1389,,"['https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/69d5599d-d71c-4830-85eb-f2bcec5126a5/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-1222', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/f6c29eb2-96f3-4a5c-ab21-9637e418dcf2/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-6584', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/c4a297b5-4223-4fd7-94bb-f40b8698a98f/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-2836', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/f34fc3ca-15d9-4167-ab6a-1d61f70cd1b1/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-4820', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/8577d9b9-e5ad-4ede-8c55-ec16ef331ee9/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-0309', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/801cfbf4-7313-4992-920c-71cb42bfe307/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-4903', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/f4569e9d-e03f-498d-a244-2ce47526c469/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-0896', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/a2e944b6-8d08-4981-992c-631bd88370c6/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-9722', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/d4874e79-1dc1-4f0f-aed4-ed436095a6ec/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-3866', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/e159ab3c-bed2-4b38-b21c-f15966a04c6b/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-8537', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/c01c234d-6595-464a-83b0-0580081e17a7/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-6572', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/69d5599d-d71c-4830-85eb-f2bcec5126a5/1980s-vintage-custom-square-metal-bronze-coffee-table-with-geometric-copper-and-silver-square-and-rectangular-patterns-1222']",Furniture,Tables,,42,18,42,"Colorado Springs, CO"

 A little about the A. Brandt Company, Inc.’s. The Ranch Oak line debuted in Fort Worth, TX in 1938 and continued being manufactured into the early 1980’s. In 1986 the company was sold. From Wolf Ranch Oak, &quot;Many of the earliest furniture designs depicted icons of ranch life carved into oak. Pictorial carvings included horses, horse heads and horseshoes, longhorns, campfires, saguaro and prickly pear cactus, and even a western scene of a cowboy riding a bucking bronco.

10011537,2000s Custom Highly Polished Wrought Iron Swivel Highchairs or Barstools Detailed Iron Work- Set of 3,"These tall swivel chairs provide a comfortable seating height with a footrest twelve inches from the ground, elegant custom wrought iron chairs are sleek and curvy pleasant to look at, perhaps like looking at a sculpture. Heavy and sturdy yet inexplicably seductive. I tried counting the welds but lost count at 1001, my apologies. The seat fabric texture appears cottony like denim which provides high fabric breath-ability. What I love about the chairs is the unexpected soft curves, pleasant almost whimsical optics. Great looking chairs. They are tall chairs, with swivel seats with a seat height of 31&quot; and armrest height of 35 inches from the floor. The total height is 43&quot;. Each chair weighs 48 pounds.

3332105,1940s French Pierce Carved Wood Coffee Table,The table belonged to an English lady who moved to the United States in the seventies and eventually settled in San Diego.  She lived in a modest bungalow by the beach - close enough to the beach that you could hear the waves crashing to shore.  The exterior of the house was a bright blue while the interior walls were painted in muted hues.  She was a collector and enjoyed an warm and wonderful variety of pieces from many periods.  This piece stood in the living room surrounded by rich Victorian upholstered chairs and a small fireplace.

4295916,French Country Style Ladder Back Rush Seats Dining Chairs - Set of 6,"Just a little back story before moving on to the chairs – the ladder-back chair is named for the horizontal slats across the back of the chair, resembling the rungs of a ladder. Often referred to as a &quot;slat-back&quot; chair, the back provides tall, upright support. The high back of the dining chair complements beautifully with a farm table, or an elegant large table. With proper care, ladder-backs are intended to last a lifetime. The rush seats are typically hand-strung, woven Seagrass, (Seagrasses are the only flowering plants which grow in marine environments), providing comfort, support and many years of use.

Between each drawer is dummy drawers, as was typical in those designs. You can have only so many working drawers before running out of room. These antique tables were first introduced in the late 18th century and have a rotating leather or inlay top, standing on a central turned pedestal. The main timber used in construction was Mahogany, usually with veneered drawer fronts and edges. The best quality antique drum tables have oak drawer linings and quality brass handles, I happy to inform you that this item has both.  However, the storage space of the drawers is small for writing pads and pens or a good place to store playing cards. These antique tables were first introduced in the late 18th century and have a rotating top, standing on a central turned pedestal.

Also, widespread travel occurred with Westerners visiting Italy, Greece, and the Middle East. At the same time, a veritable slew of publications in Europe covering these archaeological digs and publishing about these finds. Overall, there was a massively increased interest in the Classical Era at this time. 
 The “Grand Tour” of Europe, which intellectuals and aristocrats saw as part of the education of the modern European gentleman, comprised an extended visit to Rome, among other places, and many went on to Greece. This led them through a haven of Classical design styles and motifs. Everyone wanted to experience the beauty of the Hellenic Period back at home.
 The neoclassic style developed in France then quickly spread throughout Europe and to the United States.

The original brass base and cover are in wonderful condition.  The lucite pieces are still very clear and make for a striking design.
What is Lucite?  I thought it was plastic, but now I know, Lucite is the tradename of polymethyl methacrylate. Other well-known trade names are Crylux, Plexiglass, Acrylite, and Perspex. It is a transparent thermoplastic polymer. It is important as an alternative to glass in its sheet form.

It&#x27;s a custom handcrafted beauty. The scalloped shape of the table runs through to the apron and down the legs and stretchers, so many curves - such a beauty. The custom shaped thick tempered glass has and will continued to protect the desk top.  The center figures is of a lovely lady with cherubs hovering about waiting any command to obey.  However, nothing is perfect, an ormolu piece is missing from the base of one of the legs.  Brackets were added and judging by the screws in the early to middle 20th Century for support this would ensure the table top from separating from the body of the table (see pic).

Consider the height of the coffee table (CT), if you bend down to get your glass and fall over - then it probably to low. Our CT is a nice height of 24&quot; certainly not too low.

4842340,Antique C. 1870s-1890s Tiger Oak Sideboard Cabinet Three Drawers Single Door Original Hardware Knapp Joinery True Craftsmanship,"Antique c. 1870s-1890s Tiger Oak Sideboard Cabinet Three Drawers Single Paneled Door Paneled Sides Original Hardware Knapp Joinery are a sign of a true quality craftsmanship

This is an antique piece of furniture that features drawers with a curious-looking half-circle joint, after some research we are certain that it was made in a North American factory between 1871 and 1900. The round pin hole came to be known as the Knapp Joint, the joint is also variously described by its appearance: the pin and cove, scallop and dowel, scallop and peg, pin and scallop, and half-moon.

However, this method of joinery was replaced by the mid 19th century, most furniture in America was made by machines in industrialized factories—with the exception of fine drawers. Machines that could produce dovetails were taking over and only high quality pieces were being made by hand. High-quality drawers were still being produced by hand, and while a skilled craftsman could turn out perhaps 20 drawers a day, that wasn’t nearly fast enough to keep pace with the production of furniture for which said drawers were intended. Handwork was holding up the factory output. That&#x27;s pretty much the short history of Knapp joinery, you can be certain your pin and cove joinery is proof that you have an antique high quality piece of Americana.",650,,"['https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/986c91f3-ba48-4836-8825-a0792383a95d/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-8165', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/e5bc85c6-4020-40e6-8001-bd846d5ddebe/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-4036', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/5f872441-06aa-4f55-8cab-c2c1cb59a6f0/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-8760', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/c88563da-0a57-4fac-8f2d-c818580f6958/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-6839', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/bac4b794-dec5-44ec-a715-52724a17ab01/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-6969', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/c0834eb7-59f6-4eed-9ed8-72b0e47d8bb4/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-5577', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/944bb08c-6b88-4f16-853c-66a1b15eec9c/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-7913', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/b0ff0949-cdd5-424c-b1e8-c34ad41edc9c/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-2405', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/a2ed0c27-8d9b-4c55-b8cf-764ce4de3ea7/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-3900', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/45d94582-d1b6-4484-8bb0-0b249ad8ef2d/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-1450', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/570c6986-747a-4673-88f7-130d27bebd32/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-5749', 'https://chairish-prod.freetls.fastly.net/image/product/sized/986c91f3-ba48-4836-8825-a0792383a95d/antique-c-1870s-1890s-tiger-oak-sideboard-cabinet-three-drawers-single-door-original-hardware-knapp-joinery-true-craftsmanship-8165']",Furniture,Casegoods & Storage,,35,28,18,"Colorado Springs, CO"
