15410912,"""A Walk Through the Dunes"" - Oil Landscape Painting on Masonite, 2023","Nanette Fluhr’s ""A Walk Through the Dunes"" is a captivating landscape painting that brings viewers into the tranquility of a coastal path surrounded by windswept vegetation. This intimate 8 x 6-inch oil painting, crafted on masonite, beautifully showcases Fluhr's mastery in capturing natural light and atmospheric softness. The sandy trail meanders through a palette of earthy tones and soft greenery, leading the eye towards the distant hint of ocean on the horizon under a serene blue sky. Her attention to detail, especially in the subtle textures and delicate brushstrokes, brings a meditative quality to the scene, invoking the warmth and peace of a quiet dune walk.

This work is housed in a custom wooden frame, bringing the total dimensions to 9.25 x 7.25 inches, which complements the naturalistic charm of the painting. Known for her precise and evocative landscapes, Fluhr has created a piece that resonates with lovers of coastal scenes and collectors of impressionistic realism. In pristine condition, this painting is an original, signed piece by Fluhr, dated 2023.",900,,"https://a.1stdibscdn.com/nanette-fluhr-paintings-a-walk-through-the-dunes-oil-landscape-painting-on-masonite-2023-for-sale-picture-2/a_13082/a_154109121731695863606/i0xrl7aa6nzwv1zjmsze_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/nanette-fluhr-paintings-a-walk-through-the-dunes-oil-landscape-painting-on-masonite-2023-for-sale-picture-3/a_13082/a_154109121731695873435/a_walk_through_the_dunes_1__master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/nanette-fluhr-paintings-a-walk-through-the-dunes-oil-landscape-painting-on-masonite-2023-for-sale/a_13082/a_154109121731695850917/fluhr_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/nanette-fluhr-paintings-a-walk-through-the-dunes-oil-landscape-painting-on-masonite-2023-for-sale-picture-4/a_13082/a_154109121731695873405/a_walk_through_the_dunes_master.jpg",Nanette Fluhr,6.0,8.0,,1.0,"Masonite, Oil, ",American Impressionist,"Created in 2020, Period: 21st Century",Excellent
15269002,"""Gratitude 1."" (2020) By Yuko Montgomery, Original Oil Painting of Snail","Yuko Montgomery's ""Yuko Montgomery"" is an original, handmade oil painting that depicts a photorealistic portrait of a snail on a white background.

Born in Chiba, Japan, Yuko was reared by parents who appreciated every aspect of art. As a child growing up in Bangladesh her creative talents began to flourish. In 2000, Yuko attended Tama Art University in Tokyo majoring in oil painting. At that time, her method of expression gradually shifted from canvas to jewelry design. As a result, Yuko launched a jewelry brand while simultaneously attending school. Her jewelry has been sold worldwide and has collaborated with popular fashion brands.

Yuko spent several years in the Netherlands and the United States and moved to Nagasaki Japan, where it’s surrounded by beautiful mountains and the blue ocean. She was deeply impressed by the majestic nature and animals there and that led her soul to start painting again.

Yuko channels her enthusiasm for the amazing characteristics of the animals formed in the process of evolution onto canvas. Employing academic oil painting techniques in the creations of her pieces, Yuko believes that oil gives life to her art because the medium ""works inquisitively as if it has its spirit"".

Her works are housed in private collections widely around the world. Yuko is also passionate about preserving beautiful nature and the planet earth for the next generation.

About the Artist:

(Born 1970)
Denver-based artist Jim Beckner creates vibrant urban landscapes that pulse with city life. His use of clean, jewel-like pigments and energetic brushwork reflects the rhythms of bustling streets and city lights. He employs color and movement as his principal driving forces, replacing form and outline, a unique style rooted in his time at Colorado State University.

Born and raised in Lakewood, CO, art was integral to Beckner's family. His father, a watercolor artist, was instrumental in nurturing his creative inclinations from a young age. Beckner's deep connection to the city was fueled by family trips into downtown Denver, fostering an appreciation for its edginess.

His artistic journey has seen various styles from post-Impressionism to fauvism, all of which heavily rely on a robust color palette. His works often dance on the boundary of abstraction, distilling forms into bold blocks of color. This stylistic fluidity reveals a dynamic artist, capable of varying moods and rhythms within his work, akin to an album of different songs by the same musician.

Beyond his urban scenes, Beckner also explores human figures as subjects, employing color harmonies while maintaining a sense of realism. He imbues his paintings with emotional quality, making his canvases come alive with city sights and sounds.

Beckner works from his Colorado home studio, and his pieces, inspired by diverse city life and personal relationships, continue to captivate audiences, reflecting his unwavering commitment to innovative visual expression.",400,,"https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jim-beckner-paintings-duck-sitting-2021-by-jim-beckner-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-4/a_13082/a_152604221729206306202/3jsvofjhvgijt2rjelea4_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jim-beckner-paintings-duck-sitting-2021-by-jim-beckner-original-oil-painting-for-sale/a_13082/a_152604221729206185845/3jsvofjhvgijt2rjelea_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jim-beckner-paintings-duck-sitting-2021-by-jim-beckner-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-5/a_13082/a_152604221729206342085/3jsvofjhvgijt2rjelea5_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jim-beckner-paintings-duck-sitting-2021-by-jim-beckner-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-6/a_13082/a_152604221729206353852/3jsvofjhvgijt2rjelea6_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jim-beckner-paintings-duck-sitting-2021-by-jim-beckner-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-2/a_13082/a_152604221729206297427/3jsvofjhvgijt2rjelea2_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jim-beckner-paintings-duck-sitting-2021-by-jim-beckner-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-3/a_13082/a_152604221729206302504/3jsvofjhvgijt2rjelea3_master.jpg",Jim Beckner,10.0,8.0,,1.0,"Canvas, Oil, ",Impressionist,"Created in 2021, Period: 2010-",Excellent

B. 1986, Detroit, MI

As a native to the eastern side of Michigan, Cody pursued his higher education in the arts here in our state. With a bachelor's degree in illustration from College for Creative Studies, he went on to further his exploration of the arts and art theory at Kendall College of Art and Design. Cody earned his MFA from KCAD in 2013 and has since went on to pursue his study of painting full time.

Propelled by a generation of instant gratification and digital awareness, Cody strives to bring meaning to an art form that is deeply rooted in our world's history yet is now considered counter-culture: painting. His artwork investigates the space between one's leisures and self and the cultivation of American civilization through interest or distraction. 

The realism within Cody's paintings proposes discourse on the pursuit or rebellion of visual quietness, organization, and detail orientation in a mass image-seeking culture. His chosen medium of oils symbolizes craftsmanship's emergence from a digital age.

When away from his studio, Cody is often found deeply immersed in his outdoor interests of plein air painting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Nature reimagined is and will continue to be Cody's ultimate muse.",1325,,"https://a.1stdibscdn.com/cody-erickson-paintings-immersion-by-cody-erickson-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-4/a_13082/a_152588321729192939787/soqq5hiuypygc1by29s54_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/cody-erickson-paintings-immersion-by-cody-erickson-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-2/a_13082/a_152588321729192884424/soqq5hiuypygc1by29s52_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/cody-erickson-paintings-immersion-by-cody-erickson-original-oil-painting-for-sale-picture-3/a_13082/a_152588321729192935509/soqq5hiuypygc1by29s53_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/cody-erickson-paintings-immersion-by-cody-erickson-original-oil-painting-for-sale/a_13082/a_152588321729192781783/soqq5hiuypygc1by29s5_master.jpg",Cody Erickson,12.0,12.0,,1.0,"Oil, ",,Period: 21st Century,Excellent

Award winning artist, Jennifer McChristian, was born and raised in Montreal, Canada. From an
early age, she knew she wanted to be an artist. Upon completing high school, McChristian began
her art education at Dawson’s College in Montreal, Canada. In 1986, she and her family took
permanent residency in California, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Art Degree with Honors
from Otis Art Institute in 1990.

McChristian was employed as a full-time animation artist and worked on projects for various
animation studios including Disney and Nickelodeon. She has continued her studies under the
tutelage of renowned artists Robert Blue, Karl Dempwolf and Steve Huston. Her inspirations
consist of notable artists such as John Singer Sargent, Anders Zorn, Nicolai Fechin and Cecilia
Beaux.

McChristian primarily paints in oils and occasionally watercolors and gouache. She has an
affinity for painting ‘en plein air’ and also enjoys creating studio works using her outdoor
sketches as inspiration. “Painting is somewhat of a spiritual experience for me. Although
challenging at times, the end result evokes within me a sense of elation, nostalgia and harmony”.
Since 2000, McChristian has devoted herself to painting full-time and actively participates in art
events and community building programs. She conducts an ongoing, uninstructed figure drawing
workshop three times a week out of her spacious studio (that she refers to as her ‘sanctuary’)
located in the heart of Los Feliz Village, CA. In addition, McChristian teaches plein air painting
workshops in various locations throughout the United States and abroad. McChristian also finds
the time to pursue other artistic interests such as classical ballet. She believes learning is a neverending
process and continues to develop and refine her artistic talent through workshops,research, travel and frequent excursions to museums and galleries.

McChristian recently received 'Donor's Award of Excellence' from the Oil Painters of America
21st National Juried Exhibition. She was also featured in the July 2012 American Artist
magazine, Southwest Art's October 2009 publication and American Art Collector's February

15253392,"""Near Santa Fe, Evening"" (2017) By Stephen Day, Original Painting of Landscape","""Near Santa Fe, Evening"" (2017) by Stephen Day is an original, handmade oil painting that depicts a landscape in the sunset.


Stephen Day was born in Sheridan, Wyoming, and, while growing up he lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Aspen Colorado, and Durango, Colorado. He always felt the wonderfully unique beauty of the west but until he became an artist he really didn't know how to fully respond to that beauty.

Day is now a full-time artist living in Taos, New Mexico. Working mainly in oil he paints various subjects from life but the landscape is his first love. He says of his working philosophy, ""I paint almost exclusively from life trying to capture the feeling and the mood of the subject before me. This work philosophy forces me to paint quickly to get a spontaneous and fresh response, because everything around us (including ourselves) is in a constant state of change."" Day frequently paints on location and uses these smaller paintings to create larger studio paintings.

Once I finally indulged my need to create art, the door was opened and I haven’t looked back. I’ve been making up for lost time; a bit obsessed.  Art is now a necessity for me. I find true expression and balance in that world, says Goller.

Goller is inspired by simple, sensuous organic forms and the realm of colors, shapes and textures found in nature. Her thoughtful approach to subject matter can be evidenced from her tender still life work, along with a passion for rendering impressionist oils of daily life.  From her Bainbridge Island and Hood Canal studios she transitions within several genres and multiple media, including oil and pastel, as well as ancient mediums such as encaustic (molten pigmented beeswax) and egg tempera.  Goller’s approach tends to be experimental with leanings toward the classical.",575,,"https://a.1stdibscdn.com/carrie-goller-paintings-earth-sky-sea-2024-by-carrie-goller-original-mixed-media-painting-for-sale-picture-3/a_13082/a_152531121729109835726/dxl5di5yea95ug0a6ryp_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/carrie-goller-paintings-earth-sky-sea-2024-by-carrie-goller-original-mixed-media-painting-for-sale-picture-2/a_13082/a_152531121729109829090/3685rk64rpun133b73j1_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/carrie-goller-paintings-earth-sky-sea-2024-by-carrie-goller-original-mixed-media-painting-for-sale-picture-4/a_13082/a_152531121729109848971/qizgrspgs9apek8ft6do_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/carrie-goller-paintings-earth-sky-sea-2024-by-carrie-goller-original-mixed-media-painting-for-sale/a_13082/a_152531121729109712058/69ay5d3c046pfunk7ocp_master.jpg",Carrie Goller(American),14.0,11.0,,1.5,"Mixed Media, Encaustic, Wood Panel, ",Contemporary,"Created in 2024, Period: 2010-",Excellent

Stephen Day was born in Sheridan, Wyoming, and, while growing up he lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Aspen Colorado, and Durango, Colorado. He always felt the wonderfully unique beauty of the west but until he became an artist he really didn't know how to fully respond to that beauty.

Day is now a full-time artist living in Taos, New Mexico. Working mainly in oil he paints various subjects from life but the landscape is his first love. He says of his working philosophy, ""I paint almost exclusively from life trying to capture the feeling and the mood of the subject before me. This work philosophy forces me to paint quickly to get a spontaneous and fresh response, because everything around us (including ourselves) is in a constant state of change."" Day frequently paints on location and uses these smaller paintings to create larger studio paintings.

About the Artist:
Elena is an artist based in Chattanooga, TN USA.
 
Elena always wanted to be an artist. As a child in Ukraine, she received a classical art education which she used for over a decade as an architect. It was an applied form of her desire to create art. Elena moved away from architecture into teaching art to children and painting when she could, and finally she was able to focus all her time being an artist and learning.
 
She moved to America in 2013 and turned her full attention to painting.
 
She tries to use every opportunity to learn anything new – new tools, mediums, techniques – anything new at all.
 
Elena’s favorite subjects to paint are people with their personalities, moods, thoughts, and favorite things. “I really like to explore the personalities of my models through building the structure of portraiture with oil paint and paintbrush.”
 
Her current focus is portraiture. She seeks a connection with the model that she can translate to the surface.

15223662,"""Reflection"" (2008) by Jennifer Bobola, Mixed Media Abstract Painting","""Reflection"" (2008) is an original, handmade mixed media painting, by Jennifer Bobola, that presents colorful abstract expressionism.

Artist Statement:
Let’s be honest, understanding abstract art can seem like an art unto itself, a thing requiring a manual or a guru, a mind-reader, even. Often it’s something viewers approach sideways, brows furrowed, arms folded, wondering: What exactly am I looking at?

“For me,” explained Denver abstract expressionist, Jennifer Bobola, “I see abstraction as being the same as realism—it’s all real; it’s just shapes.”

Make sense? Clear as…mud? Well, here’s another way to relate: Think music, then take a look at Bobola’s flowing lines and lush shapes melding into almost-objects, and consider that she sees painting as a kind of visual music—Jazz, mostly.

Take, for example, the painting, “Chains of Love,” a subtle play of earthy tones set off by deep, rich darker hues. The only realistic aspect in this painting is a set of stairs swirling up to the right, into the light, and the harmonious chains weaving throughout: pale blue, white, gray and golden interlocking bands of color. This painting was conceived over the course of several days, first, with layers of torn paper affixed to the canvas and left to dry, then with washes of color, and, finally, finished with those defining gestural shapes. Each day, working on this painting, Bobola listened to the Jazz, Soul and Blues inspired electronica music of Massive Attack, particularly the song, “What Your Soul Sings.”

“When I’m working on a painting, I’ll put on music,” she said. “Sometimes I’ll put on one song a bunch of times so that when I go back to work the next day and hear that song, it’s like going home; the song sets the tone.”

While lots of artists listen to music while painting, Bobola’s connection is more concrete: she’s been playing the saxophone since the age of 10, studied it in college, and currently performs with two bands. For her, the connection between music and painting is, in fact, so intertwined that she believes there isn’t much of a difference between the two; it’s the same language: notes, rhythms, and progressions equal design, color, shapes, and lines.",175,,"https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jennifer-bobola-paintings-reflection-2008-by-jennifer-bobola-mixed-media-abstract-painting-for-sale-picture-3/a_13082/a_152236621728601436205/pja9ovzq129j1vkitbgq_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jennifer-bobola-paintings-reflection-2008-by-jennifer-bobola-mixed-media-abstract-painting-for-sale-picture-2/a_13082/a_152236621728601429467/7zu5v7jljde009e9r6c7_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jennifer-bobola-paintings-reflection-2008-by-jennifer-bobola-mixed-media-abstract-painting-for-sale-picture-6/a_13082/a_152236621728601453159/46g2hernjh6bhm7nni6e_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jennifer-bobola-paintings-reflection-2008-by-jennifer-bobola-mixed-media-abstract-painting-for-sale-picture-4/a_13082/a_152236621728601441294/bxkbjtu90xgk3upkmtol_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jennifer-bobola-paintings-reflection-2008-by-jennifer-bobola-mixed-media-abstract-painting-for-sale/a_13082/a_152236621728601413638/314wlozs4a9k28pjo0ek_master.jpg, https://a.1stdibscdn.com/jennifer-bobola-paintings-reflection-2008-by-jennifer-bobola-mixed-media-abstract-painting-for-sale-picture-5/a_13082/a_152236621728601447406/rhlfaq7yz6rxdqfqdo6g_master.jpg",Jennifer Bobola(American),14.0,12.0,,1.0,"Mixed Media, ",Abstract Expressionist,"Created in 2008, Period: 21st Century",Excellent
